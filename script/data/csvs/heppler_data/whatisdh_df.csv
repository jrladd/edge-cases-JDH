On there, we were able to explore more of the stories depth such as discovering which words are used more than others, also creating charts and graphs and etc.. We were also fortunate to watch the TV series 'Sherlock' to understand the story and actual characters a bit more. Another activity was when reading the novel 'Ms. Dalloway,' which consists of text on paper, with D; we did a mapping project of each of the character's main movements and sightseeing.

"If you ask to an Italian, a Finnish or an American what HC is, would you get the same kind of answer? So my first answer is to start questioning the nature of your question. I think we need to start to apply the principles of ethnographic research to our field. Considering, for example, the existence of strong cultural differences. The universal language of the digital machine gave us the wrong impression that we all share the same values, methodologies, and approaches to the study of cultural objects. It is not so, and in fact I think there is a huge potential cultural danger in our current obsession with standardization. So my second answer would be that humanities computing is a semiotic oxymoron (pessimistic answer), but also a cultural challenge (optimistic option). Sometimes I ask myself: why HC did not do to humanities what cultural studies did to sociology, anthropology, or philosophy? Think of the profound impact that CS had on their intellectual agendas. My answer is that HC lacked an effective and self-confident cultural vision. This happened, in my opinion, beacause HC until now has been mainly focused on the document culture, and consequently has adopted an approach largely dependent on conservative (or if you prefer 'conservation') practices. The 'paradigm of conservation' is largely dominant in the international scenario, led by historically monolingual and monocultural institutions like TEI, which basically tells the community not just how to encode a text, but what a text is. It has been said by other colleagues that HC is the application of computational methods to humanities research and teaching. This definition is correct, but I think that future of HC would be not just to use and apply formal methods, but to challenge existing discourses, cultures and disciplines.

So this year, I'm a Humanist who works with digital tools. I do Humanities, digitally. So should you.",Adam Rabinowitz,2014-01-01,541,"for the day of dh 2013, i defined digital humanities as the use of digital tools to do all of the following: collect richer datasets during our research; document those datasets in such a way that they can be more easily understood and reused by others; use digital datasets to identify patterns that inform us in new ways about our subject matter; and communicate our research and subject knowledge to our students and the general public in innovative, interactive, and engaging ways.
in 2014-01-01 i am less convinced by the idea that what i described above is actually a distinct field of inquiry. frankly, i think everyone should be doing the things i mentioned -- and most scholars these days are already doing at least the first thing (using digital tools to collect richer datasets). i'm also a bit put off by the title 'digital humanist' or the statement 'i do digital humanities'. these seem to me increasingly statements meant to define in-groups and out-groups (and, consciously or not, to better position the speaker for funding and promotion opportunities). so this year, i'm a humanist who works with digital tools. i do humanities, digitally. so should you.","['for', 'the', 'day', 'of', 'dh', '2013', ',', 'i', 'defined', 'digital', 'humanities', 'as', 'the', 'use', 'of', 'digital', 'tools', 'to', 'do', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'following', ':', 'collect', 'richer', 'datasets', 'during', 'our', 'research', ';', 'document', 'those', 'datasets', 'in', 'such', 'a', 'way', 'that', 'they', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'easily', 'understood', 'and', 'reused', 'by', 'others', ';', 'use', 'digital', 'datasets', 'to', 'identify', 'patterns', 'that', 'inform', 'us', 'in', 'new', 'ways', 'about', 'our', 'subject', 'matter', ';', 'and', 'communicate', 'our', 'research', 'and', 'subject', 'knowledge', 'to', 'our', 'students', 'and', 'the', 'general', 'public', 'in', 'innovative', ',', 'interactive', ',', 'and', 'engaging', 'ways', '.', 'in', '2014-01-01', 'i', 'am', 'less', 'convinced', 'by', 'the', 'idea', 'that', 'what', 'i', 'described', 'above', 'is', 'actually', 'a', 'distinct', 'field', 'of', 'inquiry', '.', 'frankly', ',', 'i', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'the', 'things', 'i', 'mentioned', '--', 'and', 'most', 'scholars', 'these', 'days', 'are', 'already', 'doing', 'at', 'least', 'the', 'first', 'thing', '(', 'using', 'digital', 'tools', 'to', 'collect', 'richer', 'datasets', ')', '.', 'i', ""'m"", 'also', 'a', 'bit', 'put', 'off', 'by', 'the', 'title', ""'digital"", 'humanist', ""'"", 'or', 'the', 'statement', ""'"", 'i', 'do', 'digital', 'humanities', ""'"", '.', 'these', 'seem', 'to', 'me', 'increasingly', 'statements', 'meant', 'to', 'define', 'in-groups', 'and', 'out-groups', '(', 'and', ',', 'consciously', 'or', 'not', ',', 'to', 'better', 'position', 'the', 'speaker', 'for', 'funding', 'and', 'promotion', 'opportunities', ')', '.', 'so', 'this', 'year', ',', 'i', ""'m"", 'a', 'humanist', 'who', 'works', 'with', 'digital', 'tools', '.', 'i', 'do', 'humanities', ',', 'digitally', '.', 'so', 'should', 'you', '.']",2014,226,3,0.01327433628318584
